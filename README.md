Printf is the third project in the curriculum at 42 School, written in C. The primary goal of this project is to emulate the behavior of the standard C library function printf(). The printf() function is a powerful tool for formatted output in C programming, allowing developers to print text and variables in various formats to the standard output stream.

This repository contains an implementation of the printf() function tailored for the 42 School curriculum. While it currently supports all the formats, some flags are yet to be fully implemented to match the behavior of the original printf() function.

The development of this printf() implementation is ongoing, with the aim of achieving full compatibility with the standard printf() function. Contributors are welcome to join in improving and refining this essential utility, ensuring that it meets the highest standards of functionality and performance.
